# NEAWeatherApp

NEAWeatherApp is a simple weather app built for Android that fetches the weather data for Singapore dynamically using APIs provided by Singapore's National Environment Agency as well as OpenWeatherMap. The app also notifies the user if the PSI levels in Singapore are in the unhealthy range or worse (according to NEA's standards).

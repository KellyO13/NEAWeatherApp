# NEAWeatherApp
Assignment for CZ 2006 - Software Engineering at NTU, Singapore.

NEAWeatherApp is a simple weather app built for Android that fetches the weather data for Singapore dynamically using APIs provided by Singapore's National Environment Agency as well as OpenWeatherMap. The app also notifies the user if the PSI levels in Singapore are in the unhealthy range or worse (according to NEA's standards). The app was built with software engineering principles in mind for CZ 2006.

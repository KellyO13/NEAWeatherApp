# NEAWeatherApp
Assignment for CZ 2006 - Software Engineering at NTU, Singapore.

NEAWeatherApp is a simple weather app built for Android that fetches weather data dynamically from APIs provided by Singapore's National Environment Agency as well as OpenWeatherMap. The app, apart from displaying the weather statistics for Singapore, also notifies the user if the PSI levels are in the unhealthy range or worse (according to NEA's standards). It was built with software engineering principles in mind for CZ 2006.
